# 🌐 KEDARSAMOT Website

This is the official website project of **KEDARSAMOT** – a fun little digital space created by two cousins to share what we own and use, from PC setups to tech gear, daily geek stuff, and other cool things we like.

🖥 Live website:

## 🧱 Structure & Content

The site consists of separate pages dedicated to each part of the project:

- **Homepage (`index.html`)**  
- **Maruš Page (`marus.html`)** – just for fun and memes 😄  
- **SeddY Page (`seddy.html`)**
- **Thenemessis Page (`thenemessis.html`)**

## 🎨 Design Status

| Page                | Status                                 |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `index.html`        | 🔧 Not yet optimized or responsive      |
| `marus.html`        | 🔧 Not yet optimized or responsive (also meme-only) |
| `seddy.html`        | ✅ Fully optimized and responsive       |
| `thenemessis.html`  | ✅ Fully optimized and responsive       |

Pages for **SeddY** and **Thenemessis** follow the new design standard and are fully responsive across devices.  
**Maruš page** is intentionally silly and not part of the main content.
